# Stack Block Game

Stack Block Game is a simple and addictive browser-based arcade game built using HTML5 Canvas, JavaScript, and CSS. The goal is to stack moving blocks as precisely as possible to build the tallest tower. As the game progresses, the blocks move faster, increasing the challenge and testing your timing and focus.

This project demonstrates core game development concepts such as animation loops, collision detection, score tracking, and persistent high score storage.
